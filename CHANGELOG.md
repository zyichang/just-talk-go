# Changelog

All notable project changes are tracked here.

## Unreleased

- Added opt-in client-side silence gating for streaming ASR. Near-silent frames are withheld before upload, which reduces duration-billed recognition cost. A pre-roll buffer re-sends the quiet onset of a word so beginnings are not clipped, the lead of every pause is still uploaded so the recognizer keeps the boundary it needs to punctuate, an optional calibration window adapts the threshold to the room's noise floor, and a heartbeat keeps long pauses from looking like an idle connection. Threshold calibration estimates the noise floor from the quietest frame in its window and is capped by `max_threshold`, so a user who is already speaking when recording starts cannot produce a threshold above real speech. A `measure_only` mode reports levels and potential savings while still uploading everything. Configured under `[voice.vad]` and disabled by default.
- Add a responsive Chinese project introduction website with a simulated recording and R-triggered retry demo, platform-specific launch commands, static HTTP preview on port 7788, and automated GitHub Pages deployment linked from both READMEs.

## v0.0.3 - 2026-07-29

- Reworked Windows modifier-only hotkeys so the low-level hook only observes key edges and never consumes or replays modifiers. `Alt+Super` works through exact physical-state matching, stale hook state is cleared without combining separate single-key presses, and system shortcuts such as `Alt+Tab` remain untouched.

## v0.0.2 - 2026-07-21

- Fixed intermittent Windows `Alt+Super` false activations where stale low-level hook state could make a later Alt-only press look like the full shortcut; Windows modifier combinations now require an exact modifier set and reset stale suppressed state after physical release.

## v0.0.1 - 2026-07-17

- Added a tag-triggered GoReleaser v2 pipeline using the official GitHub Action to build Linux, macOS, and Windows amd64/arm64 archives on native runners and publish SHA256 checksums.
- Added Windows 10/11 support with global key-state monitoring, native WinMM microphone capture, Unicode clipboard access, SendInput auto-submit, a click-through Win32 status overlay, and Windows environment checks.
- Added Windows-standard config, state, log, and per-user installation paths. Windows builds no longer require external recording or clipboard commands.
- Added an opt-in Windows microphone integration test using `JUST_TALK_TEST_WINDOWS_AUDIO=1`.
- Added a low-level Windows keyboard-hook fallback so modifier-only shortcuts such as `Alt+Super` still work when `GetAsyncKeyState` misses the physical Windows key.
- Consume Windows modifier-only voice shortcuts such as `Alt+Super` so they do not activate menus or toolbars in the focused application, while replaying unrelated modifier shortcuts normally.
- Fixed recording shutdown getting stuck while ASR audio writes were still in flight, and accept empty final ASR responses without waiting for a false timeout.
- Redesigned the Windows status overlay with per-pixel transparency, antialiased animated waveform bars, smoother capsule edges, and a soft shadow.
- Clarified README build and install setup steps for the repository directory and `~/.local/bin` PATH.
- Restricted voice hotkeys to non-text global shortcut keys, rejecting letters, digits, punctuation, Space, and similar text-producing keys.
- Avoid duplicate auto-submit on KDE Plasma by using uinput directly and not writing the Wayland primary selection there.
- TUI is now the default startup mode.
- Added persistent usage statistics for total sessions, recognized characters, average speed, and recent speed.
- Added configurable ASR hotwords.
- Added TUI help toggle with `h`.
- Improved Wayland clipboard and auto-submit behavior with `wl-copy` and `wtype`.
- Added Linux recording status overlay for X11 and Wayland.
- Added macOS support for global hotkeys, native recording, clipboard, auto-submit, recording status overlay, and environment checks.
- Removed non-cgo macOS fallback builds; Just Talk now requires cgo for native platform integration.
- Replaced the old Claude-specific agent guide with `AGENTS.md` and clarified build documentation.
- Improved toggle and hold hotkey behavior for fast repeated key presses.
- Show ASR connection and final-result timeout errors in the status UI/overlay instead of immediately falling back to idle.
- Added transient `Esc` cancel and `R` retry hotkeys while recording or showing retryable errors.
- Improved X11 overlay placement on multi-monitor setups and switched X11 rendering to an ARGB window for smoother rounded corners.
- Fixed a Wayland overlay shutdown race that could crash while closing the app, and surfaced Linux `arecord` microphone/device failures in the UI.
- Made `Esc` cancel active overlay states, including the final ASR wait state, and suppress output from canceled pending sessions.
- Improved Wayland overlay rounded-corner antialiasing, especially on KDE Plasma.
- Added `just-talk --install` and `make install` to install the binary into `~/.local/bin`.
